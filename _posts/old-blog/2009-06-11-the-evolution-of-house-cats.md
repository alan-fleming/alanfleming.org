[The Evolution of House Cats: Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-taming-of-the-cat):

> \[genetic analysis\] revealed five genetic clusters, or lineages, of
> wildcats. Four of these lineages corresponded neatly with four of the
> known subspecies of wildcat and dwelled in specific places: *F.
> silvestris silvestris* in Europe, *F. s. bieti* in China, *F. s.
> ornata* in Central Asia and *F. s. cafra* in southern Africa. The
> fifth lineage, however, included not only the fifth known subspecies
> of wildcat --— *F. s. lybica* in the Middle East—but also the hundreds
> of domestic cats that were sampled, including purebred and mixed-breed
> felines from the U.S., the U.K. and Japan. In fact, genetically, F. s.
> lybica wildcats collected in remote deserts of Israel, the United Arab
> Emirates and Saudi Arabia were virtually indistinguishable from
> domestic cats. That the domestic cats grouped with F. s. lybica alone
> among wildcats meant that domestic cats arose in a single locale, the
> Middle East, and not in other places where wildcats are common.

The article goes on to postulate that wildcats took advantage of
increased rodent populations in proximity to humans, caused by the
commencement of agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago in the Middle
East's Fertile Crescent --— much earlier and in a different location to
the established wisdom of where the relationship between man and cat
started. Makes sense though.
