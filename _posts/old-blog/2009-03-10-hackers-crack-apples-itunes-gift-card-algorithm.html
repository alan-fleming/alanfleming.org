<blockquote><p>$200 iTunes Gift Certificates are selling for less than $3 in China now that a group of local hackers has circumvented Apple's algorithm for creating the digital vouchers and built their own gift certificate generators.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was bound to happen sooner or later. It'll be interesting to see how Apple are able to counter this - at the end of the day, any mechanism that's strictly algorithm-based is going to be able to be broken.</p>
