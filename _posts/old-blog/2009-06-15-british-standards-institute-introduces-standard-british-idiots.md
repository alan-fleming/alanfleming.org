[British Standards Institute introduces Standard British Idiots](http://newsbiscuit.com/2009/06/15/british-standards-institute-introduces-standard-british-idiots/#comments):

> Following a 30 percent increase in domestic accidents, the British
> Standards Institute has recruited 1000 Standard British Idiots (SBIs)
> to perform safety tests on a range of appliances. A spokesperson
> explained: ‘For years we have worked on the assumption that nobody in
> their right mind would stick a spoon into a live socket, but they do.
> We have recruited this calibre of person: someone who will look for a
> gas leak with a match, or set off across the channel on a lilo.’

I'm thinking of setting up a nomination web page for them.
