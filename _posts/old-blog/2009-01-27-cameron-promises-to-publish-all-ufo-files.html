<blockquote><p>Tory leader David Cameron has vowed to publish any secret files that may exist on UFOs if he becomes prime minister.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, when he doesn't (because there are none) or if there are redactions (for obvious reasons) or even if they say that there are no sightings that don't have at least a plausible scientific explanation, he'll be accused of a cover-up.</p>
<p>Is there <em>nothing</em> this man won't promise in order to get elected?</p>
