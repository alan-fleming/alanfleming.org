A man who killed two British tourists in Florida will not go to jail --- even though he fled the scene and lied to the police. [Ryan LeVin paid an undisclosed amount](http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/news/local/ct-met-levin-hit-and-run-2-20110603,0,7039906.story?page=1)
to the widows of those he killed, and will serve two years house arrest.

The offences' sentencing guidelines call for up for 45 years' imprisonment.

For all people complain about the UK justice system, I'm glad that it's pretty much as it is.
