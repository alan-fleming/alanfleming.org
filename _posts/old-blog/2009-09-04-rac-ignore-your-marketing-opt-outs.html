<p>Is this a legal fail in any way? Quotes from a letter received from the RAC today:</p>
<blockquote><p>You've asked us not to send you any information about the other products and services RAC could offer you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed I did.</p>
<blockquote><p>Normally we wouldn't, but we've made some important changes at RAC that could benefit you. So, as a valued member, we wanted to make sure you were aware of them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: Because we actually don't give a fuck about you, we'll ignore your stated instructions and tell you anyway.</p>
<p>Did they even <em>look</em> at the chance this would piss off more people than would buy from them? Idiots.</p>
