![Text-based Pacman](/images/pac-txt.png)

I think there is a fair chance that this game will become repetitive,
pretty quickly. Can't quite put my finger on the reason why :)

If you want to play, you can find [Pac-Txt here.](http://pac-txt.com/)

There are also the [Pac Man Dungeons](http://www.masswerk.at/pmd/), but they bring certain unnecessary graphicalness to the whole game :)

Found on [Offworld](http://www.offworld.com/).
