It's a dream, but it's a good one. Look around in the map on the link.
The house to the left of the blue door is where I spent many many
holidays as a kid.

The main window, on the middle floor, used to be a big bay window where
you could sit in and read books and watch the fishing boats come in and
out of the nearby harbour. I'd change it back to how it was.
