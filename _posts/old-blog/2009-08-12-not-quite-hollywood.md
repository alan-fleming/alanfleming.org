[Hollinwood sign apes LA's
rival](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/8194803.stm):

> A recreation of the iconic Hollywood sign, which nestles in the
> Californian hills, has appeared on a grass verge by the side of the
> M60 - in Hollinwood.  
> No-one has yet claimed responsibility for the sign, which at 3ft
> (0.9m) high is dwarfed by its famous cousin.  
> An Oldham Council spokesman said it was "definitely not a council
> initiative".
