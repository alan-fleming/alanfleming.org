I always kinda wanted one of these very cute, very clever robotic
dinosaurs - but I've missed the boat. It seems as if Ugobe, the company
that made [Pleo](http://www.pleoworld.com/), has [gone the way of the dinosaur](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2345667,00.asp) and filed
for bankruptcy. A real shame.
