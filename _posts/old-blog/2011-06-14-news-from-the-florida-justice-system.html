<p>A man who killed two British tourists in Florida will not go to jail --- even though he fled the scene and lied to the police. <a href="http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/news/local/ct-met-levin-hit-and-run-2-20110603,0,7039906.story?page=1">Ryan LeVin paid an undisclosed amount</a> to the widows of those he killed, and will serve two years house arrest.</p>
<p>The offences' sentencing guidelines call for up for 45 years' imprisonment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/columnists/fl-levin-sentence-mayocol-b060711-20110606,0,304445.column?page=2">His lawyer was the Judge's deputy campaign treasurer.</a></p>
<p>For all people complain about the UK justice system, I'm glad that it's pretty much as it is.</p>
