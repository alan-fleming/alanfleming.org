<p>Look what French kids get up to at their A-Level equivalents:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=controversy-french-classrooms-modifying-bacteria">Controversy Erupts in French Classrooms over Permitting Teens to Genetically Modify Bacteria: Scientific American</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>A row has broken out in France over whether 15- and 16-year-olds should be allowed to create transgenic Escherichia coli bacteria in the classroom.</p>
<p>Practical experiments in which students learn how to use plasmids to alter the DNA of the bacteria have been under way for 17 and 18-year-olds in the final year of the scientific baccalaureate at schools across France for the past decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I was in my final year in School, in 1985-6, we used to be able to do biology at this sort of level (not exactly of course, plasmids hadn't even been <i>discovered</i> then --- but approximately the same level of technique.</p>
<p>I bet kids in the final year of A-Levels in the UK nowadays aren't even allowed <i>near</i> live cultures, let alone being allowed to breed new ones.</p>
