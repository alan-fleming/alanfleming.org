There's a great post by [Charlie Stross](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/) on his blog today,
[linking the current noise in the USA about healthcare reform and also the release of Abdelbaset Al Megrahi from prison in Scotland:](http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2009/08/merciless.html)

This is very true amongst the suburbanised middle class of America. It's
worse than just a lack of mercy --- it's an ingrained conservative
selfishness —-- all I care about is that *I* get what I believe I deserve.

Unfortunately, I'm hearing this a lot again from people here who don't
remember the Thatcher years. Listening to a party in the garden two
doors up from me last night, there was expressions of exactly the same
selfishness. Expect the four to twelve years after the next election to
be frightening, people.
