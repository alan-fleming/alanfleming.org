Look what French kids get up to at their A-Level equivalents:

[Controversy Erupts in French Classrooms over Permitting Teens to Genetically Modify Bacteria: Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=controversy-french-classrooms-modifying-bacteria):

> A row has broken out in France over whether 15- and 16-year-olds

> Practical experiments in which students learn how to use plasmids to

When I was in my final year in School, in 1985-6, we used to be able to
do biology at this sort of level (not exactly of course, plasmids hadn't
even been *discovered* then --- but approximately the same level of
technique.

I bet kids in the final year of A-Levels in the UK nowadays aren't even
allowed *near* live cultures, let alone being allowed to breed new ones.
