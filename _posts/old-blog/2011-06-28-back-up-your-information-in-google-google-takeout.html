<p>Worried about the amount of information you have stored in Google services? Fear not. Just launched today is <a href="https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1">Google Takeout</a> --- which allows you to take a local backup of (so far, some of) the information stored in several of the Google services.</p>
<p>It's not yet full--featured: it only allows backup from Google Buzz, Contact and Circles, Picasa Web Albums and from your Google profile. But the <a href="http://www.dataliberation.org/">Data Liberation Front</a> promise to add the ability to back up other Google services over time.</p>
<p><a href="http://dataliberation.blogspot.com/2011/06/data-liberation-front-delivers-google.html">This is their blog post announcing the service.</a> Remember: backup early, backup often.</p>
