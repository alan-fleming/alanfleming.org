<blockquote><p>Yahoo is shutting down GeoCities, a free service that hosts personal home pages for consumers, which it acquired for more than $4 billion during the dotcom boom 10 years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>This makes me feel a bit sad &mdash; my first ever homepage, designed in 1995, was hosted on GeoCities. Long gone unfortunately.</p>
