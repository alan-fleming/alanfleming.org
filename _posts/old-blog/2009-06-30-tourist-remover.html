<blockquote><p>Remove moving objects such as tourists or passing cars from your photos. Take multiple photos from the same scene and the &laquo;Tourist Remover&raquo; blends them into a composite photo without any interfering elements.</p></blockquote>
<p>A free service from snampmania.com. I've not tried this yet as I don't have a suitable set to use, but if it works, and I can download the resultant composite image again at decent resolution, I think I'll be using this a lot.</p>
