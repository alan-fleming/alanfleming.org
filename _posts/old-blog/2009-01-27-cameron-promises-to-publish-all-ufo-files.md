[Cameron promises to publish all UFO files](http://www.theherald.co.uk/news/news/display.var.2484947.0.cameron_promises_to_publish_all_ufo_files.php):

> Tory leader David Cameron has vowed to publish any secret files that

Of course, when he doesn't (because there are none) or if there are
redactions (for obvious reasons) or even if they say that there are no
sightings that don't have at least a plausible scientific explanation,
he'll be accused of a cover-up.

Is there *nothing* this man won't promise in order to get elected?
