<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/7858042.stm">Skinflints error prompts apology</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>First Bus has apologised to residents of a Falkirk village after wrongly labelling it Skinflints on timetables.<br />
The error was made for buses travelling to Skinflats, near Grangemouth, which has a population of about 350.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was brought up about three miles from there. OK, it's a depressing place - flat as a pancake on a river estuary, housing stock pretty much all from the 1930s. But the <em>people</em> are fine!</p>
