<p>Good news on the <a href="uac-flaw-by-design-says-microsoft.html">User Access Control flaw</a> I wrote about a few days ago - the Windows 7 engineers have <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/05/uac-feedback-and-follow-up.aspx">promised to fix it</a> in the release candidate, and have gone even further in the fix than was asked.</p>
<p>The additional proposal is to run the User Access Control panel in a mode where other programs cannot manipulate it without first gaining elevated rights. This should put and end to any potential exploit via this route.</p>
<p>Good to see the engineers responding to this. The fact that they had to, however, leads me to wonder if they're not a little insulated &ndash; they talked about "Customer Driven Engineering" in their previous post <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/02/05/update-on-uac.aspx">clarifying their views on the flaw</a> (now changed of course) but surely a little bit of common sense and engineering experience should have told them that this was wrong, regardless of what the behavioural monitoring they performed suggested?</p>
