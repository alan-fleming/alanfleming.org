Using public WiFi is becoming risky, if you pass important information
insecurely over it. There are freely available tools out there that will
listen in to all the network traffic, looking for passwords --â€” and now
there are tools, like Firesheep, mentioned below, that will hijack
sessions you've already securely logged into.

Takeaway lesson? Any time you're using a public WiFi spot, encrypt all
activities if you can. And *definitely* encrypt passwords going to your
mail server. I'll be enforcing that last one on my mail server in the
next few days.
