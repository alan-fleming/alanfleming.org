title: This is the Tablet PC I want

I've always been a fan of Tablet PCs. Mainly because I'm completely and
utterly in love with [Microsoft OneNote](http://office.microsoft.com/onenote) –-- it's the killer app for
Tablet PCs and for everyone in general who needs to keep their random
stuff together on a PC. Goodness knows why it's not pushed harder than
it is.

Anyway. I still look around the tablet PC space from time to time, but
have not found anything that's inspired me recently. This has changed.

The [Dell Latitude XT2](http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-latitude-xt2)
looks to have fantastic specs –-- small (an inch thick!) plus speccing it
with a decent amount of memory and a 6-cell battery comes in at around
£1300. There's an optional 9-cell battery the slides onto the base but
that obviously compromises size and weight.

I'm still not sure I'd want to have a Tablet PC (or a netbook!) as my
*only* machine. But this would be an absolutely brilliant carrying
computer, I think.
