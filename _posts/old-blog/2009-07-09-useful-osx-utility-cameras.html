<p>One small problem with OSX is that it does the same thing every time you plug in any camera &mdash; starting Aperture, for example. The trouble is, while that may be sensible when you're plugging in your main camera, it's a pain when connecting up your iPhone.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flexibits.com/">Cameras</a>, a free preference pane from <a href="http://www.flexibits.com/">Flexibits</a>, sorts out this problem. It allows the action taken on connection to be set per-device.</p>
<p>It's working perfectly here, and fixes one of my longstanding frustrations with OSX. With it, attaching the various devices I have that take photos now Just Works.</p>
