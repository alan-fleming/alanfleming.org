<blockquote><p>Following a 30 percent increase in domestic accidents, the British Standards Institute has recruited 1000 Standard British Idiots (SBIs) to perform safety tests on a range of appliances.  A spokesperson explained: &lsquo;For years we have worked on the assumption that nobody in their right mind would stick a spoon into a live socket, but they do.  We have recruited this calibre of person: someone who will look for a gas leak with a match, or set off across the channel on a lilo.&rsquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>I'm thinking of setting up a nomination web page for them.</p>
