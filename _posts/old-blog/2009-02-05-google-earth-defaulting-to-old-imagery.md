title: Google earth defaulting to old imagery?

I'm having a weird problem with the new version of Google Earth. Looking
near me in Manchester, it's defaulting to an old image set –-- around 2004
or so –-- when they have later images available.

Let me show you:

![2009.jpg](/images/2009.jpg)

This is the default image of a street corner near where I live. I hadn't
paid much attention to it until now. But using Google Earth's new
feature to go back in time, I started to look more closely.

![2005.jpg](/images/2005.jpg)

This is the same corner from a set of images from 2005. It's clear to
see the site has been cleared, ready for re-building.

![2003.jpg](/images/2003.jpg)

But here we are, looking at the 2003 image set --- and it's *exactly the
same as the default view.*

This is clearly wrong --- Google definitely has more up-to-date images
than the ones they are showing by default for Manchester. Has anyone
else had this problem? Can others check their locale to see if there are
problems where they live too?
