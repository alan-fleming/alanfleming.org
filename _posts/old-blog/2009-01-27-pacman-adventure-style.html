<p>I think there is a fair chance that this game will become repetitive, pretty quickly. Can't quite put my finger on the reason why :)</p>
<p>If you want to play, you can find <a href="http://pac-txt.com/">Pac-Txt here.</a></p>
<p>There are also the <a href="http://www.masswerk.at/pmd/">Pac Man Dungeons</a>, but they bring certain unnecessary graphicalness to the whole game :)</p>
