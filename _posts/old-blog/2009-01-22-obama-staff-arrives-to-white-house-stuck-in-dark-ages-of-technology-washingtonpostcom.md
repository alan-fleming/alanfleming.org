No Instant Messengers. No Facebook. A week to get a computer and a
Blackberry. No laptops! Computers that have *individual purposes?* This
is going to be a painful transition from a very internet-savvy campaign.
Hopefully they will gain the ability to change the White House
bureaucracy - while the Presidential Records Act is important, it can't
be beyond the ability of people to have a White House IT infrastructure
suitable for the Internet Age.
