One small problem with OSX is that it does the same thing every time you
plug in any camera â€”-- starting Aperture, for example. The trouble is,
while that may be sensible when you're plugging in your main camera,
it's a pain when connecting up your iPhone.

[Cameras](http://www.flexibits.com/), a free preference pane from
[Flexibits](http://www.flexibits.com/), sorts out this problem. It
allows the action taken on connection to be set per-device.

It's working perfectly here, and fixes one of my longstanding
frustrations with OSX. With it, attaching the various devices I have
that take photos now Just Works.
