Is this a legal fail in any way? Quotes from a letter received from the
RAC today:

> You've asked us not to send you any information about the other
> products and services RAC could offer you.

Indeed I did.

> Normally we wouldn't, but we've made some important changes at RAC
> that could benefit you. So, as a valued member, we wanted to make sure
> you were aware of them.

Translation: Because we actually don't give a fuck about you, we'll
ignore your stated instructions and tell you anyway.

Did they even *look* at the chance this would piss off more people than
would buy from them? Idiots.
