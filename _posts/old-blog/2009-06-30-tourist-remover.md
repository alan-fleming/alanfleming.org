[Tourist Remover](http://www.snapmania.com/info/en/trm/index.html):

> Remove moving objects such as tourists or passing cars from your

> Remover» blends them into a composite photo without any interfering
> elements.

A free service from snampmania.com. I've not tried this yet as I don't
have a suitable set to use, but if it works, and I can download the
resultant composite image again at decent resolution, I think I'll be
using this a lot.
