[Microsoft dismisses Windows 7 UAC security flaw, continues to insist it is “by design”](http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090131/microsoft-dismisses-windows-7-uac-security-flaw-insists-by-design/):

Just because it's by design doesn't mean to say it's right. This is
exactly the blinkered thinking that we heard from the people working on
UAC in the Vista timeframe --- "This is the way it's going to be, we know
better than you."

Since that attitude was provably incorrect last time, what makes it any
more right *this* time?
