<p>Postcodes are an essential part of location services in the UK. However, they're not free &ndash; they are owned by the Post Office, who will charge you a hefty sum in order to get access to the database.</p>
<p>Hampering free and innovative location-based services? Likely. Easy to reverse-engineer? You betcha!</p>
<p>The <a href="http://freethepostcode.org/">Free the Postcode project</a> intends to build a public domain database of postcodes, in the same way that the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">Open Street Map project</a> intends to build a free map of all streets in the UK, thus breaking the Ordinance Survey's hold on that information.</p>
<p>However, if you have an iPhone, Free the Postcode has a free application that uses the phone's GPS for location, combined with your submission of the postcode. <a href="http://tr.im/flzw">This link will open it in iTunes.</a> There's also an <a href="http://www.andnav.org/index.php/de/menu-improve-maps/menu-add-uk-postcode">app for Android phones.</a></p>
<p>This is an excellent idea and well worth supporting.</p>
