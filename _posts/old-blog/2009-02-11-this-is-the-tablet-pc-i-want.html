<p>I've always been a fan of Tablet PCs. Mainly because I'm  completely and utterly in love with <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/onenote">Microsoft OneNote</a> &ndash; it's the killer app for Tablet PCs and for everyone in general who needs to keep their random stuff together on a PC. Goodness knows why it's not pushed harder than it is.</p>
<p>Anyway. I still look around the tablet PC space from time to time, but have not found anything that's inspired me recently. This has changed.</p>
<p><img src="/images/01425sz1i20041000.jpg" alt="Dell Latitude XT2" /></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www1.euro.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/laptop-latitude-xt2">Dell Latitude XT2</a> looks to have fantastic specs &ndash; small (an inch thick!) plus speccing it with a decent amount of memory and a 6-cell battery comes in at around &pound;1300. There's an optional 9-cell battery the slides onto the base but that obviously compromises size and weight.</p>
<p>I'm still not sure I'd want to have a Tablet PC (or a netbook!) as my <em>only</em> machine. But this would be an absolutely brilliant carrying computer, I think.</p>
