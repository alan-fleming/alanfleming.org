<p>You'd like to think that people really shouldn't leave those great big electronic signs at the side of the road (effectively) world-writable, should you know?</p>
<p>However, often, they are. Therefore it was definitely good of <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com">i-hacked.com</a> to <a href="http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/274/48/">publish the instructions</a> of what to do when you find one.</p>
<p>I certainly hope there's going to be a flickr group for, erm, edited signs, soon...</p>
