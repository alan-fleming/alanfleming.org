<p>Flower is the sort of game that appeals to me. It's beautiful. It's simple. And it's the antithesis of adrenaline-pumping must-fight must-win games &mdash; </p>
<p><a href="http://playstation.joystiq.com/2009/01/19/ps3-fanboy-hands-on-flower/">Joystiq writes</a>: "The premise is simple. You are a gust of wind inside a flower's dream and you must carry petals to other flowers in order to progress to the end of the level. There's no time limit, no hazards, no points system and, really, no way to fail."</p>
<p>Flower is set for release in early February.</p>
