<p>Not exactly <em>subtle</em> but when you look like a crocodile to start with, it probably doesn't matter that much really...</p>
<blockquote><p>In December 2008 an unfortunate 3-m long, wild American crocodile Crocodylus acutus was run over by a car, in Florida. The animal sustained substantial head injuries: apparently its snout was 'hanging limp' and it was unable to feed. It was captured and taken to the Miami MetroZoo.</p></blockquote>
