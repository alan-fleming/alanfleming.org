<p>This is to where, one day, I would hope to retire:</p>

<p>It's a dream, but it's a good one. Look around in the map on the link. The house to the left of the blue door is where I spent many many holidays as a kid.</p>
<p>The main window, on the middle floor, used to be a big bay window where you could sit in and read books and watch the fishing boats come in and out of the nearby harbour. I'd change it back to how it was.</p>
