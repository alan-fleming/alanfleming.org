title: Alex Salmond's criticism of the UK Supreme Court is grandstanding

So, Mr. Salmond would like to see the removal of the Supreme Court's
power to decide Human Rights issues with regard to the Scottish criminal
justice system. Moreover, he has chosen to personalise the issue [by attacking Lord Hope](http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2011/jun/01/alex-salmond-scotland-supreme-court),
the deputy president of the Supreme Court, and previously lord justice
general of Scotland. The situation has become so farcical that the
Scottish Government, led by the SNP, are looking at removing funding for
the Supreme Court.

Loads of heat and noise there, against a target that, to retain its
impartiality, does not involve itself in politics. It's easy to shoot at
something that won't shoot back, isn't it?

Anyway, the changes the SNP are proposing will *not* mean that decisions
of the Scottish criminal courts will not be prone to any review --- it
will mean that, as before the introduction of the Scotland Act and the
Human Rights Act, Human Rights challenges to it will have to go to the
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg rather to the UK Supreme
Court. This will of course mean considerable delay compared to now. And
on the European Court of Human Rights there are precisely no judges with
extensive understanding of the Scottish criminal justice system. On the
UK Supreme Court, there are two --- Lord Hope and Lord Rodger, who is
unfortunately ill at the moment.

What Alex Salmond is doing is transparent --- and it has nothing at all
to do with the quality of justice in Scotland, or the rest of the UK.
Salmond, as leader of the Scottish National Party, has just won a
majority in the Scottish Parliament. His party are committed to a
referendum on whether Scotland should be independent or not in the
latter half of this parliamentary session. It is therefore to his
advantage to criticise decisions made by others that affect Scotland ---
it's the old "them and us" ploy. While Mr Salmond has always had a
tendency to play the "poor downtrodden Scots" card at every opportunity,
to personalise the attack against the Scot who, with the other members
of the Supreme Court, is the last bastion against Human Rights-based
miscarriages of criminal justice in Scotland, is reprehensible.

What we should *really* be questioning here is the decisions of the High
Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh. In both [their judgment in *Fraser*](http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2008HCJAC26.html) and
[*HMA v McLean*](http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/scot/cases/ScotHC/2009/2009HCJAC97.html)
(the forerunner to [*Cadder*](http://www.supremecourt.gov.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2010_0022_Judgment.pdf))
--- the latter with a bench of no less than seven justices --- they have
got a point of Human Rights law wrong. What is causing this difficulty
in correctly analysing whether aspects of the Scottish criminal justice
system is compliant with the Convention on Human Rights?
