<blockquote><p>Telling the magazine [the <a href="http://www.radiotimes.com/">Radio Times</a>] that he was also asked why he did not give "credit" to the Lord, Sir David continued: "They always mean beautiful things like hummingbirds.</p>
<p>"I always reply by saying that I think of a little child in East Africa with a worm burrowing through his eyeball.</p>
<p>"The worm cannot live in any other way, except by burrowing through eyeballs.</p>
<p>"I find that hard to reconcile with the notion of a divine and benevolent creator."
</p></blockquote>
<p>I do, too.</p>
