Worried about the amount of information you have stored in Google services? Fear not. Just launched today is [Google Takeout<](https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1) --- which allows you to take a local backup of (so far, some of) the information stored in several of the Google services.

It's not yet full--featured: it only allows backup from Google Buzz, Contact and Circles, Picasa Web Albums and from your Google profile. But the [Data Liberation Front](http://www.dataliberation.org/) promise to add the ability to back up other Google services over time.

[This is their blog post announcing the service.](http://dataliberation.blogspot.com/2011/06/data-liberation-front-delivers-google.html) Remember: backup early, backup often.
