<p>This is going to by my central blog. Given that Livejournal may be in terminal decline due to the recent layoffs of technical staff, I've decided to centralise here, in a blog under my own control.</p>
<p>I'll still be posting to Livejournal, but anything new there will be locked for my friends. Blog entries from here should be automatically posted across.</p>
<p>I may also re-post items from previous blogs, in order to consolidate them in one place. Apologies if you've read them before.</p>
