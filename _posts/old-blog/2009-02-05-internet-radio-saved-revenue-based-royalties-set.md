I'm glad that this has been finally sorted out. It's taken bills in the
Senate, court appeals and over two years of negotiation to find a
solution that enables internet radio broadcasters –-- like my favourite
[SOMA FM](http://somafm.com/) –-- to pay royalties based on their income
rather than on a notional amount per song.

The negotiation process clearly hasn't been smooth, and it doesn't seem
as if any side ends covered in glory here. But the user-supported
internet radio stations will continue to play a more diverse and
interesting playlist than any commercial station. I'll boost my
subscription by a dollar or two a month to ensure I can still listen to
that.
