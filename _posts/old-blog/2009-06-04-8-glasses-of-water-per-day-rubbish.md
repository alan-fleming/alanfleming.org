I'm glad to see that finally, some scientific investigation is being
done on this old canard. [And it turns out you don't need to drink litres of water per day at all:](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=eight-glasses-water-per-day)

> According to Heinz Valtin, a retired professor of physiology from

The National Academy of Sciences's Institute of Medicine also researched
this in 2004:

> Its panel on "dietary preference intakes for electrolytes and water"

> vast majority of healthy people adequately meet their daily hydration
> needs by letting thirst be their guide."

So there you go. Your body has a perfectly good way of telling you it
needs a bit of topping up. Short of an illness that requires you to
over-hydrate, or weather requiring the same, drink when you're thirsty
and stop worrying.
