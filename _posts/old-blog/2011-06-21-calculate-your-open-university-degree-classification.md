I have just found this and though it worth a mention and link: Cleveret's [Open University Degree Class Calculator](http://cleveret.net/?page_id=29)  It seems to do all the hard work correctly, including calculating the quality assurance scores.

Very useful if you want to work out what grades you need --- therefore also what averages you'll need to achieve in your course work over the course of the year. Accurately knowing the target you need to hit is pretty much essential, I think.
