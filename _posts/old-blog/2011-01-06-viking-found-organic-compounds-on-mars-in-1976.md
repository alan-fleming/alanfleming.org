Using Mars-like soil taken from Atacama Desert, a study confirms Mars
has organics, and Viking found them.

A reanalysis of Mars Viking experiments shows the probes did find
organics.  
The result was not initially understood due to the strong oxidation
effects of a salt in the Mars soil known as perchlorate.  
A follow-up study on perchlorate-enhanced soil similar to what's found
on Mars revealed fingerprints of combusted organics.  

The Viking 1 Lander, illustrated in this model, touched down on the
western slope of Mars' Chryse Planitia (the Plains of Gold) on July 20,
1976.
