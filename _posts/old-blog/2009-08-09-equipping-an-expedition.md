It's been a long time since I last read ["Time Enough for Love"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love) by Robert
Heinlein, but I'm having flashes of one part of it at the moment.

I have an idea for a web application --â€” one that could work out very well
indeed, and I've given myself four months in startup mode to see if I
can make it happen. I'm at the end of the second week of this, and I
still keep thinking of things I need to get done in order for this to
work. Some of them are complicated, like coding a feature of the
application. Some are simpler, like writing a data privacy policy.

In the novel, there is a sequence where the protagonist is setting out
on a pioneering trip. With a fixed amount of carrying capacity, he works
and re-works the list of items to take, and at least once has the shock
of realising he's missed something obvious but vital off the list.

I'm going through that right now. My app will involve taking payment for
its function. So how the heck did it take me *two weeks* to realise I'll
need to buy an SSL certificate, in order to secure the transmission of
peoples' sensitive information?

*facepalm*

(This whole is big, scary, and fun. I should talk a little more about it
here.)
