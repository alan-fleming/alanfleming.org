You'd like to think that people really shouldn't leave those great big
electronic signs at the side of the road (effectively) world-writable,
should you know?

However, often, they are. Therefore it was definitely good of [i-hacked.com](http://www.i-hacked.com) to [publish the instructions](http://www.i-hacked.com/content/view/274/48/) of what to do when you find one.

I certainly hope there\'s going to be a flickr group for, erm, edited
signs, soon...

Noticed on the [B3ta newsletter](http://b3ta.com/newsletter/issue362/).
