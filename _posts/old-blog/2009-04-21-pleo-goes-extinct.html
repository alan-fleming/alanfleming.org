<p>I always kinda wanted one of these very cute, very clever robotic dinosaurs - but I've missed the boat. It seems as if Ugobe, the company that made <a href="http://www.pleoworld.com/">Pleo</a>, has <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2345667,00.asp">gone the way of the dinosaur</a> and filed for bankruptcy. A real shame.</p>
