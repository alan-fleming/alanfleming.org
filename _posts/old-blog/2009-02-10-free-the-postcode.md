Postcodes are an essential part of location services in the UK. However,
they're not free â€“-- they are owned by the Post Office, who will charge
you a hefty sum in order to get access to the database.

Hampering free and innovative location-based services? Likely. Easy to
reverse-engineer? You betcha!

The [Free the Postcode project](http://freethepostcode.org/) intends to
build a public domain database of postcodes, in the same way that the
[Open Street Map project](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) intends to
build a free map of all streets in the UK, thus breaking the Ordinance
Survey's hold on that information.

However, if you have an iPhone, Free the Postcode has a free application
that uses the phone's GPS for location, combined with your submission of
the postcode. [This link will open it in iTunes.](http://tr.im/flzw)
There's also an [app for Android phones.](http://www.andnav.org/index.php/de/menu-improve-maps/menu-add-uk-postcode)

This is an excellent idea and well worth supporting.
