<p>I have been waiting for this to happen for twelve years, ever since my first multiple-thousand-seat Windows desktop rollout - Windows 7 (and Windows Server 2008 R2) can be added to domains <em>without physically being connected to that domain over a network</em></p>
<p>This is done with a new command - djoin.exe - added into these products. It's used (on an existing machine in the domain) to generate a block of information in a file, that can be used on another machine to automatically join the domain without being connected at that time.</p>
<p>This is fantastically useful for anyone performing big corporate rollouts &ndash; where it's not always possible to build the machines <em>in situ.</em> Any consultancy working on a build-and-customise desktop project for a client is going to absolutely love this. </p>
