<p>I've been travelling again - San Francisco and Washington DC this time.  Well worth it, and more on Washington later. Meanwhile, in Sf I actually gave money to a panhandler. Because he'd trained his animals to do the following:</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/mouseoncatondog.jpg" alt="mouseoncatondog.jpg" /></p>
<p>I thought that was well worth a couple of dollars.</p>
<p>The dog wasn't being hurt by the cat, the cat was sitting on a leather pad on the dog's back.</p>
