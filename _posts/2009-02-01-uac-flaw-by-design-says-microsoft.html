<p><a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com/20090131/microsoft-dismisses-windows-7-uac-security-flaw-insists-by-design/">Microsoft dismisses Windows 7 UAC security flaw, continues to insist it is &ldquo;by design&rdquo;</a>:</p>
<p>Just because it's by design doesn't mean to say it's right. This is exactly the blinkered thinking that we heard from the people working on UAC in the Vista timeframe - "This is the way it's going to be, we know better than you."</p>
<p>Since that attitude was provably incorrect last time, what makes it any more right <em>this</em> time?</p>
