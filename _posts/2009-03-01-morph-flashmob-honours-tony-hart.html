<blockquote><p>A flashmob of tiny Plasticine figures have gathered on London's Bankside to honour the memory of the late TV artist Tony Hart.<br />
Almost 200 models in the shape of children's TV favourite Morph were arranged in a Terracotta Army-style formation outside Tate Modern.<br />
Hart's daughter Carolyn Williams said she was "completely bowled over" by the gesture in memory of her father.</p></blockquote>
