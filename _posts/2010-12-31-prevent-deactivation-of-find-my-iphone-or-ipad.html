<p>It's not often I'm posting computer or phone-related stuff here any more, but this one is clever and deserves wider attention: </p>
<p><a href="http://hints.macworld.com/article.php?story=20101226201756182">Prevent deactivation of Find My iPhone - Mac OS X Hints</a>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Currently if you do not have a password on your device a thief (or child) could deactivate Find My iPhone. However most people don't know that you can prevent this by using a passcode. (This might require iOS 4.2 or later; I didn't have an earlier version to test it.) </p>
<p>To prevent anyone from turning it off you can do the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open Settings and go to 'General.'</li>
<li>Scroll down and tap on 'Restrictions.'</li>
<li>Turn on restrictions and enter a four digit passcode and repeat to turn on.</li>
<li>Under 'Allow Changes:' turn both of the switches Location and Accounts to Off.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you cannot disable find my iPhone without the passcode. This also prevents changes to anything related to location services and changes made to your email accounts.</p>
