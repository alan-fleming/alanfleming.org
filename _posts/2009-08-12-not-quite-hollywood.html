<blockquote><p>A recreation of the iconic Hollywood sign, which nestles in the Californian hills, has appeared on a grass verge by the side of the M60 - in Hollinwood.<br />
No-one has yet claimed responsibility for the sign, which at 3ft (0.9m) high is dwarfed by its famous cousin.<br />
An Oldham Council spokesman said it was "definitely not a council initiative".</p></blockquote>
