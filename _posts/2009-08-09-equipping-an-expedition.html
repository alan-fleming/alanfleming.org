<p>It's been a long time since I last read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_for_Love">"Time Enough for Love"</a> by Robert Heinlein, but I'm having flashes of one part of it at the moment.</p>
<p>I have an idea for a web application &mdash; one that could work out very well indeed, and I've given myself four months in startup mode to see if I can make it happen. I'm at the end of the second week of this, and I still keep thinking of things I need to get done in order for this to work. Some of them are complicated, like coding a feature of the application. Some are simpler, like writing a data privacy policy.</p>
<p>In the novel, there is a sequence where the protagonist is setting out on a pioneering trip. With a fixed amount of carrying capacity, he works and re-works the list of items to take, and at least once has the shock of realising he's missed something obvious but vital off the list.</p>
<p>I'm going through that right now. My app will involve taking payment for its function. So how the heck did it take me <em>two weeks</em> to realise I'll need to buy an SSL certificate, in order to secure the transmission of peoples' sensitive information?</p>

<p>(This whole is big, scary, and fun. I should talk a little more about it here.)</p>
