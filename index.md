# Welcome to my web pages

I'm Alan. Welcome to my web pages.

There was a time where a website was the core of an online identity: containing a blog, or a gallery, or acting as a showcase for your work. These days are, for many, well in the past and there are plenty web sites - like this one - where the main reason now is to act as a stepping-off point to a range of other social identities. You will find those as icons in the sidebar to the left.

There used to be a blog here: a few pages have been preserved as one or two of them still seem to be useful, according to Google. That's the reason for the disclaimer.
