I'm a law graduate, not a lawyer. All commentary and analysis in this blog is my own work - but there is *absolutely no guarantee that it is legally correct.* I'd like to think it is, but that's as far as I can go. Consider yourself warned: you can't rely on it, and if you do, that's not something for what I can be held responsible. Heck, considering you can't even tell if I change the article when you're not looking, might it be an idea to try Wikipedia first? :)
